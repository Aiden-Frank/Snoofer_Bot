# Snoofer_Bot
This repository contains code for operating a robot I built, called Snoofer Bot.

Code under Bot_Code is intended to be run on the robot.  Main.py is the primary one, the rest are for testing.
Computer_code contains code to be run on a laptop nearby, to recieve and store data from the robot.
